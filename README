DESCRIPTION
------------
This is the IDL code required to generate ORAC forward model lookup tables 
(LUTs).  The main routine is in "create_orac_lut.pro" and there is a wrapper 
procedure, in "create_orac_lut_wrapper.pro", for running batch jobs.  Besides 
requiring IDL the code has one external dependency, the so called EODG Mie code 
[Grainger et al., 2004], a mixture of IDL and Fortran callable through the IDL 
DLM interface.  The code also calls the original Fortran implementation of 
DISORT [Stamnes et al., 1988] through a DLM interface.  For details on the LUTs 
and the methodology for producing them see McGarragh and Others, 2016.


INSTALLATION
------------

The code requires the EODG Mie code available at:

https://github.com/eodg-code/mie

Please consult the README.txt file in the EODG Mie distribution for 
instructions on compiling the IDL DLM interface to the Fortran Mie code.

Please consult the README.txt file in the disort/ subdirectory for instructions 
on compiling the IDL DLM interface to the DISORT code.


USAGE
-----
In order to use this code the IDL_PATH and IDL_DLM_PATH variables must be set 
to this directory and the various dependencies (mie/, mie/dlm-code/, 
create_orac_lut/disort/src/ and create_orac_lut/dubovik/).  These may be set 
either as an environmental variable or within IDL with the PREF_SET command.

create_orac_lut may be called directly with the procedure in 
create_orac_lut.pro.  Please see the extensive documentation in the procedure 
comment header for a description of the required arguments and keyword 
arguments.

create_orac_lut may also be called with the procedure in 
create_orac_lut_wrapper.pro.  In this case the arguments passed are contained 
in a driver file given directly to create_orac_lut_wrapper as a keyword or 
contained in the file equal to the CREATE_ORAC_LUT_DRIVER environmental 
variable.  Please see the comment header for create_orac_lut_wrapper for more 
details.

create_orac_lut requires several input files.  Several example input files are 
contained in the example_driver_files directory.  Essentially, there are five 
different types of files:

- Instrument definition files: *.inst, which define the channels of a given 
instrument.

- Pressure profile files: *.dat, which define the atmospheric pressure and 
temperature as a function of height.

- Scattering properties files: *.mie, which define the components, height 
distribution and microphysical properties of an aerosol or cloud type/class.

- LUT definition files: *.lut, which define the axes/grid of the output lookup 
tables.

- Gas optical depth files: *.gas, which provide the gas extinction profiles 
(due to molecular absorption) for a given channel of a given instrument.  These 
may be produced with MODTRAN.  They are optional and required for the ORAC 
aerosol retrieval but should not be included for LUTs for the ORAC cloud or ash 
retrievals.

- create_orac_lut_wrapper files: *.driver, which is used to pass arguments of 
create_orac_lut procedure into the create_orac_lut_wrapper wrapper procedure as 
mentioned above.

Detailed descriptions of these files are in the comment headers of their 
corresponding read procedures in create_orac_lut_io.pro.

In the case of the instrument definition files these can be usually used 
unchanged but for the other files it is up to the user to use them as templates 
and modify them according to their requirements.

The set of nine example driver files represent a set of example runs that try 
to cover all the common code paths and should be used by developers for 
regression testing.  It is recommended that developers reduce the number of 
output channels in the driver files and the number of output solar zenith 
angles in the *.lut files to speed up testing.  Below is a brief description of 
each driver file.  Though only two instruments, AATSR and MODIS, are covered in 
these examples/tests, switching instruments is as easy as using a different 
*.inst file and modifying the channel related driver file inputs accordingly.

aatsr_CCI_A70.driver,
aatsr_CCI_A72.driver,
aatsr_CCI_A76.driver:

These driver files are a few samples from the full set of 10 driver files for 
Aerosol CCI retrievals.  A70 contains 3 components, A72 contains 4 components, 
and A76 contains two components.  A70 and A72 both have a T-matrix components 
[Dubovik et al., 2006] whereas A76 has only Mie components.  All the components 
are 'user' defined.  Finally, since these examples are for the ORAC aerosol 
retrieval they include gas absorption.

aatsr_maritime_80rh.driver:

This driver file is of interest as all three components are from OPAC.  Gas 
absorption is also included.

aatsr_opac_desert_dust_NSCM.driver:

This driver file example contains 4 components, one that is an OPAC component, 
two that are user defined Mie components, and one that is a user defined 
T-matrix component [Dubovik et al., 2006].

modis-aqua_ICE_baum.driver,
modis-terra_ICE_baum.driver:

These driver file examples contain a single ice crystal component.  The source 
of the optical properties is that of Baum et al. 2014.  Here there are two 
driver files to emphasize that fact that these ice crystal properties are 
platform specific.

modis_EYJ_A81.driver

This example contains a single user defined log-normal mode.

modis_ICE_baran.driver

This driver file is for a single single ice crystal component the source of 
which is optical properties from Baran and Havemann, 2004.  Notice that this 
one is not platform specific.

modis_WAT.driver

This driver file is for a single modified-gamma distribution of liquid water 
droplets and is what is used for the Cloud CCI retrieval.

Please see the comments in the source files themselves for further information.
